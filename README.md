# Digital-Monophonic-Synthesizer

This is a digital monophonic synthesizer built within verilog. The project was completed with my partner and it has a built in sequencer and ram module to save notes. 

In the first mode, the user will be able to manually input the sequence of notes to be played but will not be able to record in real-time. This would involve them selecting which step of the sequence they would like to enter a note for and pressing the appropriate key. The currently selected step of the sequence and the note that will be played at that step will be displayed for the user to see while they are editing the sequence.

In the second mode, user can record notes in real time and then play them back. The user can play a certain set of keys, and the sequencer will automatically go through them and playback the notes. The user can also edit particular notes, raise the volume, and finally change the sound due to different implemented clock waverforms.
